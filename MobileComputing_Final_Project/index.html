            <h3>
                Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause infection in humans and various animals, including birds and mammals such as camels, cats and bats.
                 Some animal coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are <span>communicable from animals to humans.</span>
                 <br></br>

            <h2>
                Where did COVID-19 come from?
            </h2>

            <h3>
                COVID-19 is a new strain of the coronavirus which has not previously been detected in humans. The outbreak started in <span>the Chinese city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province.</span>
                 The outbreak initially appeared to be linked to South China Seafood City.<br></br> Seafood, chickens, bats, marmots and other wild animals are sold at this market, suggesting that the virus likely originates from an animal source.
                  The virus is <span>human-to-human transmissible</span> and has meanwhile spread to other countries.
                  <br></br>

            <h2>
                What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

            <h3>
                The symptoms range from <span>mild to severe respiratory disorders with fever, coughing and breathing difficulties.</span>
                 The <span>elderly and people with existing chronic conditions</span> appear to be more vulnerable to serious symptoms.<br></br>
                  Certain population groups are considered to be more at risk; they are more vulnerable to developing serious symptoms.
                   These are mainly <span>people over 65 years of age</span> and <span>people suffering from serious chronic diseases.</span>
