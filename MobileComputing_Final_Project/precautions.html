                <li>
                    <h2>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</h2>
                    Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
                </li>
                <br></br>
                <li>
                    <h2>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</h2>
                    When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.
                    If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
                </li>
                <br></br>
                <li>
                    <h2>Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</h2>
                    Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
                    Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
                </li>
                <br></br>
                <li>
                    <h2>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</h2>
                    Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.
                    This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
                </li>
                <br></br>
                <li>
                    <h2>Stay home if you feel unwell.</h2>
                    Self isolation is an important part of mitigating the spread of COVID-19. By doing this, you protect others who may have compromised immune systems or underlying health issues
                    which may cause them to be susceptible to the virus.
                </li>
                <br></br>
                <li>
                    <h2>If you have a fever, a cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance.</h2>
                    National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. 
                    Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
